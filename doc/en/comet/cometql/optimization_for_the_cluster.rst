====== Optimization delete, and insert in CometQL ======

In order to optimize the internal logic operations delete, and insert does not return the number of rows affected.

Perhaps then it will change, but for now the case. This is done to be able to return an answer sooner than would know the number of rows affected.

If you care to know how many people delivered a message that it is possible to learn a separate request.
