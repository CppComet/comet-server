The public developer’s ID serves as a login on the comet-server and the secret developer’s key serves as password on the comet-server. That’s why new requirements appear to storage and publication of these values.

The public developer’s ID may be not hidden – it is needed to pass both in using JavaScript API and in using with CometQL.

The secret developer’s key – is needed for using CometQL (and its secure may refer to like every other password). This value is encouraged not to publish and in the case of exposure it is necessary to get online support.
